# MemTimings-Linux
Find your memory Timings of a Ryzen Zen2+ cpu under linux!

The program is currently in beta, so expect some bugs.
It requires sudo/root privilages, just like ZenTimings on windows.
It works by using Cyring's SMU address reader, and parsing the 
binary strings into memory timing numbers.
